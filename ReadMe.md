## Need
Many of the data processing tasks outlined in the [HREP-Mussel-Manual](https://mpdougherty.github.io/HREP-Mussel-Manual/index.html) are tedious, error prone, and repetetive. These are tasks ripe for automation and standardization with tools. 

## Funding
This project has been funded by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) [Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program (UMRR)](https://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Missions/Environmental-Protection-and-Restoration/Upper-Mississippi-River-Restoration/). <img src="images/UMRRlogo_tag_rgb_300px.jpg" align="right" />
